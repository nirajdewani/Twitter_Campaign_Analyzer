* Defining the framework/metric. Considerations:  
  1. \# of favorited tweets / # of retweets.<br />
  2. \# of followers / # of tweets per account could sway data (e.g. a bad campaign with 1 million followers could look better on surface compared to a good campaign with 100 followers).<br />The focus is on comparing the Twitter accounts of these companies:  
  1. Medtronic Diabetes vs Omnipod vs Tandem (Continuous Glucose Monitor and/or Insulin Pump makers)
  2. One Touch vs AccuChek (USA) vs Abbott Freestyle (meter makers)
  3. NLP / sentiment analysis.<br />
